SAMVAAD 📡💬
"Where words flow like butter on a hot paratha." 🧈🥞
Samvaad is not just a chat application. It's your personal "let's talk about it" zone, built to connect people across the digital chaat-stalls of the internet. With a sprinkle of Tailwind CSS, a dash of React, and a hearty ladle of Socket.IO magic, we’ve got the perfect recipe for seamless conversations.

🛠️ Built With Love (and Code):
Frontend: React.js ⚛️ (Yes, it’s faster than your chai brewing in the morning!)
Backend: Express.js & Socket.IO 🚀 (Because chatting needs speed and reliability.)
Database: MongoDB 🍃 (Where your chats live happily ever after.)
Styling: Tailwind CSS 🌬️ (Smooth like butter, responsive like your over-attentive aunt.)

🤔 Why Samvaad?
Because texting on other platforms was starting to feel like yelling into the void. Samvaad brings back the charm of real-time, "Did-you-see-my-message-before-I-typed-it?" chat. Here's what makes it stand out:
Real-time Conversations: No awkward silences here—instant delivery. 📨
Sleek UI: Your chat interface just got an upgrade. Tailwind CSS is here to flex. 💅
Dark Mode: Because conversations are deeper at night. 🌙
Lightweight: Won't take longer to load than your favorite meme page. 🚴‍♂️💨
